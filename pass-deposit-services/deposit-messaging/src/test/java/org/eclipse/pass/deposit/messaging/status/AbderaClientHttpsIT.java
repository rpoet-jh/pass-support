/**
 * Insures that the Apache {@code AbderaClient} can connect to https URLs, specifically the ability to trust the root
 * of the certificate chain for the JScholarship SSL certificate.
 * <h4>Implementation Notes</h4>
 * As of 10/11/2018, the root of the certificate chain for https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu is the <em>AddTrust
 * External CA Root</em>, expiring 5/30/2020, with SHA-1 fingerprint {@code 02 FA F3 E2 91 43 54 68 60 78 57 69 4D F5
 * E4 5B 68 85 18 68}.  We care about JScholarship and this certificate because it terminates the SSL connection to
 * the SWORD endpoint used for deposit by Deposit Services.  The {@code AbderaClient} must be able to negotiate an SSL
 * connection to this server in order to resolve SWORD service-related documents.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As it happens, more recent JREs already trust the <em>AddTrust</em> CA.  The Alpine Linux image that runs Deposit
 * Services has the <em>AddTrust</em> CA present in {@code /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8-openjdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts}.
 * Therefore nothing special needs to be done in order to use SSL and TLS with the SWORD endpoint.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The SWORD endpoint is protected by username and password.  The SWORD endpoint used by this test is the <em>production
 * </em> endpoint, because that's the endpoint ultimately being contacted by Deposit Services.  The staging SWORD
 * endpoint uses a different URL, but also requires authentication and is not available outside of the JHU network.  If
 * the staging endpoint was publicly available, and if there were a secure mechanism for storing authentication
 * credentials, then this test could be executed automatically every time ITs are run.  However, because this test
 * contacts the production endpoint, and because it requires username and password authentication, this test is
 * {@code @Ignore}ed by default, and must be executed manually on the command line:
 * </p>
 * <pre>$ mvn clean verify -Dit.test=AbderaClientHttpsIT -Dftp.skip -Ddspace.skip -Dpostgres.skip -Dfcrepo.skip
 * -Dsword.user=<username> -Dsword.pass=<password></pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Future implementations of this test should probably use a lower-level library to verify SSL/TLS connectivity without
 * relying on Abdera. There is no need to login and resolve the service document to prove SSL/TLS connectivity, but for
 * now it was expedient.
 * </p>
