/**

 * <p>
 * Upon invocation of any {@code public} or {@code protected} methods of {@code PipedInputStream}, the presence of a
 * {@link Throwable} (stored in a member {@code volatile} variable) is checked.  If a {@code Throwable} is present, it
 * indicates that the <em>writing</em> side of the pipe encountered an exception.  The writer is executing in a
 * separate thread, and cannot report exceptions "up the stack" to the caller.  Instead, the writer (via a {@link
 * Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler}) sets any caught exceptions on the <em>reading</em> side of the pipe, and the
 * reading side of the pipe will re-throw them to readers if {@link #setWriterEx(Throwable)} is called with a non-{@code
 * null Throwable}.
