 * Implementations must support and align with the {@link PackageOptions.Spec packaging specification} provided in the {@code Map} of
 * package options.  For example, a BagIT implementation would {@link #packagePath(DepositFileResource) path} all of the
 * custodial content under a {@code data/} directory, and BagIT tag files would be supplied as {@link
 * #finish(DepositSubmission, List) supplemental resources} under the base of the package.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code PackageProvider} is invoked when <em>writing</em> the {@code PackageStream} in response to {@link
 * PackageStream#open()}.  Any exceptions should be thrown as {@code RuntimeException} to prevent a corrupt {@code
 * PackageStream} being streamed to callers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A new {@code PackageProvider} is instantiated each time {@code PackageStream#open()} is invoked.  Implementations are
 * not expected to be invoked by multiple threads.
